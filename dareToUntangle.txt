Dare to untangle?

We've built a layered, complex, slowing-down
society. So this sim builds a A society with
bots. It is a simulation, based on simple Javascript.

It is not actually 'based on' but rather
made with Javascript language. ;-) 


## The Microview of real life:

If you look at your own daily life, it may look 
completely different than a calm planned : 

 ..zzwW!bcCgLdR..

 b= brush your teeth immediately upon waking
 c= charge your devices for the day following up! preparedness
 g= get ready with me!
 d= daily stuff (duties consisting of (deeper_level))
 R= return from the duties
 z= resting, zzz (not awake)

## Programmed-in Phenomena in simulation

Programming-in means that these features are
explicitly thought-out. So these are by 
a human original programmer. Whether or not
there are emergent properties later on, 
it's an interesting question! Tbs.

  news
  a seer (who sees) can create "News"
    attention needed
    motivation to produce
    understanding also a bit
    good reporters just report!

## The reporting schema: How to report, in actuality?

## world-firsts  in the sim:

lzw_inventor? 
  Who creates a packing algorithm

rix_inventor?
  run length packing algorithm variant

## Bota types (what are the different architectures)

Idea-crafter [a_bota]    
  sell an idea
    visionary bot can be consulted
    sparrative bot also, they are good!

visionary [a_bota]
  has tally capability
  looks at things
  "1+1 != 3"!! Eureka! 
  Gets thing wrong, and then some. Ideas are borne?

sparrative [a_bota]

tallyer [a_bota]
  algebraic genius, soon? ;-)
    professor of algebra
      numpy inventor
  uses "paper"
  writes
  scribbler
  needs_a_pen

pen_giver [a_bota]




## Architecture: Classes in the game

...requirements packed on top of each other. 

Building botic societies with the help of 
AI taught me something. 

Bots are tiny agents that just have a few 
things they can do. 

It is up to you, what these bots do, how they
think, and what they see. And how they
interact. So they are building a society.

Bots as a software -idea originated as far
as the PCWars, and CoreWars. 

The idea back in these systems was to introduce
little core failures, memory glitches into 
systems: the core failures were basically used
to ask a crucial question in the age of 
space race: 

if a ray does damage to a RAM chip, what happens?

## Questions in A simulated world:

  How well bots tally?

  How many bots can tally? (as % of population live)

  How many bots are reporters?
    have reported, one News, past N turns

  Who finds the a* algo? 

  is it the algebraicist, or the warehouse man from a trashcan?

  a* 
    finder of the a* pathfinder?
