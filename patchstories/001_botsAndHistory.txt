# Bots and Their History

Bots are software agents—programs that can perform specific tasks.  

It is up to you to decide what these bots do, how they think, what they perceive, and how they interact. In multi-agent systems, these interactions can sometimes produce emergent behaviors that resemble a society.  

The idea of autonomous programs dates back decades. One early example is **Core Wars** (1978), a game where small programs competed in a simulated memory space. These programs didn’t damage actual hardware; instead, they “attacked” each other within the game’s virtual environment.  

While the Space Race inspired research into fault-tolerant computing—such as protecting RAM from cosmic ray damage—Core Wars and similar systems were recreational programming experiments rather than hardware tests.

For Space Race: see books of history

and google for the story. 

Space race is the endeavour to get into space, 
by rockets and other propulsionary means.

From Earth, to the space, then to Moon, and beyond.
