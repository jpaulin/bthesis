# A Chessa Game - strategy of the invisible

A simple Python simulation game with an 8x8 board inspired by chess rules:

- **Whites**: Move only onto white squares.
- **Violets**: Can see whites only if they are on black squares and move to attack them.
- **Soldiers**: Represented as circles (one type per color).
